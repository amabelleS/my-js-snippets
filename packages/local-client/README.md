## About this project ❤️

Published to npm, together with 2 other pkg: a cli, and an express server for the local-api. The local cliend will be served with the build files of this react app. After installing the packege, the user will run the serve command in the cli, and a window will open in hers/his browser. The users will be able to add text or js code snippets, that will be transpiled and bundled automatically with esbuild, and will be able to see the results in an iframe window. Also, saving all in his local file system.
